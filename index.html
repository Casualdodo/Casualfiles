	<p><h3>WHAT IS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING?</h3><br>
	Computer Programming is the process by which programmers give computer instructions on 
	how to perform the desired tasks. Programmers often write and test software that is designed
	by developers. Programmers may also look back at previous programmers to make changes as they see fit.</p><br>
	  Computer programmers need to be goal orientated with a keen eye for detail as well as a willingness to learn as they go. The most rewarding part about 
	  this occupation is definitely the money that you can earn through your own independent work. In contrast, the primary challenge of this occupation is 
	  trying to stay up to date with the latest languages and programs available in the marketplace.<br>
	  <h3> WORKING AS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER.</H3>
	 Computer programmers are often paid a salary rather than a wage due to the potentially volatile nature of technology. Prompting programmers to work odd hours
     wherever they may be.  The outlook for new programmers is fairly bleak as supply has recently outgrown<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm"
	 target="_blank"> demand</a>.<br>
	 <h3>SCHOOLING</h3><br>
	 For schooling I may be attending the University of Wisconsin Lacrossse because it is a quality education that is still close to home. At Lacrosse I would be studying <a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/globalassets/info-pages/academics/information-systems.pdf" 
    target="_blank"> Information Technology </a> as part of a four year course to
	 earn a Bachelors degree in the subject. The schooling itself will be fairly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm"target="_blank"> expensive. </a> 
	 after a degree is earneed and a job found. A computer programmer will be very quickly not be drowning in crippling debt but will only be swimming in it.<br>

	 <h3>MY HOUSING</H3><br>
	 As I will be dealing with a limited budget, I will be utilizing the accomodations provided by my own personal dumpster bin. My home costs less than $500 so it is a very safe financial option without sacrificing the safety and security of a traditional home.
	 My home will be without utilities as I will be living as travelling programer. My vehicle of choice for my perilous journeys as a free-lance dumpster programmer is going to be a 2018 Fortwo Electric Drive Prime Coup. The vehicle itself is a very sleek and spooky model. It only costs
	 about $300 dollars a month after the 2,000 due at signing.<br>
